- 555 phase1+2 could be faster by
    - have phase1 return all solutions of the shortest length
    - could build a lookup table of phase2 costs...there are only 165 million states in phase2
    - could also have phase2 return all solutions of the shortest length
    - could phase3 then work for multiple phase1+2 solutions?  This would give us a way to find the
      shortest phase1+2+3 solution.

- 555 phase456 solution could be faster by
    - solve a bunch of cubes and find average solution lengths for phase5 and phase6
    - try all wing_str combos but put IDA max thresholds based on average solution lengths for phase5 and phase6
    - that would give us a much much faster way to try many wing_str combos

- 555 phase456 solution needs an option to take the 333 solution into account
