- 555 phase1+2 could be faster by
    - have phase1 return all solutions of the shortest length
    - could build a lookup table of phase2 costs...there are only 165 million states in phase2
    - could also have phase2 return all solutions of the shortest length
    - could phase3 then work for multiple phase1+2 solutions?  This would give us a way to find the
      shortest phase1+2+3 solution.

- 555 phase456 solution could be faster by
    - solve a bunch of cubes and find average solution lengths for phase5 and phase6
    - try all wing_str combos but put IDA max thresholds based on average solution lengths for phase5 and phase6
    - that would give us a much much faster way to try many wing_str combos

- 555 phase456 solution needs an option to take the 333 solution into account


- 555 combine phase1+2..attempt #432
    - solve a few hundred of today's phase1 where we stage LR
    - use that to build a 2D heuristic matrix based on x-center cost and t-center cost. This
        will give us a way to get a heuristic that goes up to ~10.
    - we can use that same matrix for the UD x-center and t-centers
    - use multiplier 1.10, that will round 5 to 6, 6 to 7, etc
    - assume we can eventually find a solution, even it if takes a few hours.  Do this for a 
        few hundred (maybe thousand) cubes and then we can build a 4D heuristic matrix where the
        heuristic goes up to ~16.
