5x5x5
=====
There are 5 scenarios that the last two edges can be in so there should be 25
scenarios that the last 4 edges can be in.  We need to do lookup tables to
solve 4 edges at a time, this should save us a lot of steps on edge pairing.

This will be in pair_multiple_edges_555()


6x6x6
=====
When we solve the LFRB centers today we:
- solve LR
- use IDA to solve LFRB
where solving LR is one prune table and solving FB is the other.

Instead of solving LR all the way, what if at each step we check to see
if the cube is in a state that is in the LFRB IDA table?
