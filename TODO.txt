- all of the "def lookup" table functions need to return the steps not exec the steps
- clean up all of the IDA related function names, make them consistent
- make the lookup-table.txt filenames consistent

- compress lookup-table-5x5x5-step10-stage-UD-centers.txt ? It is 29G, I think I could get it down to ~2.5G
    - Need to split this so it is in multiple files, max file size is 100M on github
    - would need a way to then uncompress it or work with it in its compressed form
    - same for lookup-table-5x5x5-step20-stage-LR-centers.txt (11G)
    - same for lookup-table-5x5x5-step30-ULFRBD-centers-solve.txt (9G)
    - same for lookup-table-5x5x5-step31-UDLR-centers-solve.txt (2G)

- remove the leading UUUU and trailing DDDD from
    - lookup-table-4x4x4-step02-LR-centers-stage.txt
    - lookup-table-4x4x4-step20-LFRB-centers-solve.txt

Compress the tables
- only store the next move to make the tables smaller
- store the cube state as hex...this can only be done for staging tables
