5x5x5
=====
There are 5 scenarios that the last two edges can be in so there should be 25
scenarios that the last 4 edges can be in.  We need to do lookup tables to
solve 4 edges at a time, this should save us a lot of steps on edge pairing.

This will be in pair_multiple_edges_555()


6x6x6
=====
Centers solving needs to be made more generic so larger even cubes can reduce
their centers to a 6x6x6.
- Reduce all centers to a 5x5x5 and use the 5x5x5 solver
    - stage UD inner x-centers
    - stage UD oblique edges
    - solve UD inner x-centers and oblique edges...(8!/(4!*4!))^3 is 343000
    - UD is reduced to 5x5x5

    - stage LR inner x-centers
    - stage LR oblique edges
    - solve LR inner x-centers and oblique edges...(8!/(4!*4!))^3 is 343000
    - LR is reduced to 5x5x5

    - solve FB inner x-centers and oblique edges...(8!/(4!*4!))^3 is 343000
    - FB is reduced to 5x5x5
