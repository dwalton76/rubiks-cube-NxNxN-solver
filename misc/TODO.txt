- code cleanup

4x4x4 last two edges
====================
- Try with and without the tweak that pairs two edges at once. This should be
  faster most of the time but there are cases where if we do this it always
  leads to PLL parity. Basically resolve the edges with this enabled and if it
  cannot find a PLL free solution then try without.

- re-read the "pair 6 edges at once" page



Misc
====
- redo how 5x5x5 centers are solved, it is a mess, use the following instead
    http://rubik.rthost.org/5x5x5_centres.htm

- redo how 555 edge parity IDs are assigned, this is also a mess at the moment


5x5x5 UD center options
=======================
Do all three of these and see which approach solves UD centers with the fewest moves.
Obviously #1 will be more moves than #2 but #2 requires a pretty huge lookup table so
do this comparison to see if #2 is worth it.

#1 - Solve U centers, then D center edges and corners while preserving U
#2 - Solve U centers (lookup table), then D center edges and corners while preserving U
#3 - Solve UD center corners (lookup table), then U center edges while preserving D, then D center edges while preserving U
#4 - Solve UD center corners (lookup table), then U center edges without preserving D, then D center edges and corners while preserving U


5x5x5 last two edges
====================
- find the patterns that require multiple parity ID sequences...create new parity IDs
  from these and once we have them all, drop the "while True" loop in resolve_555_edge_parity()
  and barf if we ever find a new one


solver.py
=========
- clean up the use of pos vs square_index
- clean up the use of wing vs edge

- get_solution_score()
    - Instead of counting the number of steps in a solution come up with a score for
      how long we think the robot would take to solve it

- compress_solution()
    - combine "U U" into U2
    - remove x,y,z steps

- group_edges() and get_edge_we_can_solve_with_least_moves()
    DONE - lot of cut-n-paste code
    - Instead of calling move_wing_to_F_west just rotate xyz to get it there. This
      should save us 5-10 moves in pairing edges for 4x4x4

- bring in the python kociemba solver?


2x2x2 solver
============
- ungolf the 2x2x2 solver
    - wrap your head around how the hell this thing works
