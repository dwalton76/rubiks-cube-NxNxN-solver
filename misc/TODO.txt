    - The difference is the TPR solver finds 10k phase1 solutions and keeps the best 500 (the
      ones with the lowest phase2 centers heuristic).  It then searches for a phase2 solution
      for those 500 phase1 solutions, it does this by starting with a very low IDA threshold
      and incrementing it by one after trying to find a solution for all 500 scenarios. It then
      keeps the best 100 phase2 solutions and does the same basic process for finding the best
      phase2 + phase3 combo.

      I am unable to get phase2 to run fast enough to do this though. TPR does some pruning
      that I do not understand. This is the skipAxis2 stuff...need to wrap my head around this.

      Note that my phase1 does EO where all edges are oriented correctly.  I do this just to speed
      up phase2 where it is looking for edges to be EO but in any orientation.

      Long term I think bidir IDA is the way to go here, we could just combine phase 1 and phase 2
      (which the TPR solver is somewhat doing)

- Add "cube.cpu_mode = 'tsai'" to test.py and run this overnight
time ./utils/test.py --test-cubes utils/test_cubes.json.small --size 4x4x4


- edge pairing table is building to 11-deep on LJs machine

=====
5x5x5

- edge pairing is still awful...revisit lookup tables but with pattern2 approach
    - see ac5a482e45315345db438b61887c240e5e6732d1

- tsai today is
    - stage UD centers
    - stage LR centers (and in turn FB)
    - phase2 starts (solve LR centers and do EO)

    we could save a lot of steps by doing
    - stage UD centers
    - phase2 (solve LR centers and do EO)
    - could always build the full LRFB prube table (165 million entries) if IDA is slow

- tsai phase3 needs to be finished
    - pair edges at LB, LF, RB, RF
    - LFRB centers must be vertical strips

- tsai phase4
    - restrict F, F', B, B' to preserved the 4 edges
    - solve centers and finish reduction

step80...we spend 40+ moves in this phase
    - build the main table out to 6-deep

    - we solve LR and then FB prune to speed up step80...can we avoid
      this with the extra entries of a 6-deep table? Combine these on
      LJs machine and see how crazy big it is.

    - the step80 table could be converted to hex to make it much smaller
      Would also chop out the "x"s

    - build a bunch of 24 million entry prune tables?

    - would open a lot of doors in terms of tackling much larger IDA searches
        - first to try is staging all 5x5x5 centers via one phase
        - second to try is staging all 5x5x5 centers via one phase
        - combine phases 1 and 2 of tsai?

    - start from a solved cube and work your way back to the scrambled cube

    - requires us to build prune tables for each scrambled cube
        - for 4x4x4 staging centers we can do this in ~20 minutes in python
        - if we only build it out 4 steps deep we can do it in ~20s
        - so this would have to be done in C and even then it would still
          take some time.  I think this is a strategy that could only be
          used in a fewest moves challenge given how long it will take to
          produce solutions.
